# SRM-Ideathon-2.0- Women Security App

PPT on "Women's Security App".

Hi Judges, its team UNITED presenting our idea on Womens Safety . Actually it's ashame that we need an app to ensure women's safety . Keeping the personal opinions apart let's jump to the big picture . In this competitive world where men and women have equal opportunities it's important to keep the opportunities safe and secured for women with respect to the environment. Nowadays due to recently happened cases such as molest by drivers or colleagues, women security, has become the foremost priority of the world. Although it's not limited to urban but data can e extracted from rural too.

Talking about the problem statement we aim for providing highly reliable security system for the safety of women which will be capable of tracking the current location of the victim or either inform the police about the distress.

The idea is to provide with an application which easily understands distress situations and works accordingly. Be it contacting parents or friends or police station in emergency the app is capable of doing it along with location and distress signal . For easy accessibility shaking mobile or tapping the power button certain times would initiate the distress signal.

Now the question arise like why this app when there are already such apps around. The ans to this is in drawbacks of earlier system.Good network connectivity isnt the consistent thing. Also accurate location is indeed a difficult task to deal when it comes to depending on network and technology. Also when someone is in that situation of distress its important keep it simple for the mind to work that's why old way of initiating the app manually wouldn't be effective and an alternate has to be given.

Our app has several unique features that hope to solve the old drawbacks. Whenever user shakes mobile or taps power button several times distress signal is initiated thereby immediate responding and alerting along with dialing to the nearest police station. Also there is no need to manually initiating the app. The above initiates the app automatically.

The main challenge with such idea is to deal with network. Therefore we took that matter to fact and make an alternative. In case of online distress signal and alert message is send to user emergency contact list along with dialing to the nearest police station . While for the offline the nearest police station is dailed for the distress. 

Talking next about the feasibility. Technical feasibility depends on performance and cant be predicted to the fullest but only assumptions can be made. Whereas operational feasibility takes whether the app is capable of holding and working with large data with accurate processing. Then we have economic feasibility which depends totally on resource cost depending on technical analysis.

Now we have the features of our app. There is scream alarm which could be police siren or loud scream depending on the choice of user. Then there is track me which sends user dynamic location to the emergency contact list alerting about the distress. Then we have where are you which works like find my phone app and let's the connected people see about the users location without disturbing. Then its low battery alert alering friends or people in emergency about battery thing. Then importantly we have emergency distress signal which gets initiated as user shakes or taps several times the power button.

We also have some hidden features like when emergency distress signal is initiated voice and video recording starts in background thereby capturing background sounds and activities which could be used to identify the culprit.Taking next about accessibility it works with or without internet connection.

Lastly the aim was to develop such app that at the time of Distress what's basic comes to mind implemented with the Idea to make it more Efficient.
